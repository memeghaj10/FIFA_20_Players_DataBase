# README coming soon!!!!

This is our Sem-4 Mini-Project submission for Data Base and Management Systems. We have tried to connect `my-sql` to `python` using `mysql-connector-python` and have made an overall data-base for FIFA-20 player, which can store thier :-

1. OVR
2. Age
3. Club
4. Nationality
5. Positional-Play

We have then used the data to perform some simple C-R-U-D operations, and further then the same can be used for Data-Analysis too.

While, this was an attempt from our side, to make something better, but we intend to make a few additions like:-

1. Create Front-End/GUI using py-game/Tkinter.
2. Giving Pie-Chart/Graphical Analysis of Players and Clubs based on OVRs and age factors.
3. and much more.....


Hope to make the changes soon.... :)
